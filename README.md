# click_the_ball
Implementation of a simple "click the ball" game using pure C and the OpenGL library. This project was originally implemented as part of programming classes activities in 2017, when I was teaching at IFRJ (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). The original software was a simple, one file, structured implementation to show how to program graphics and player interactions. With the time, after some iterations this software became more flexible, robust and data driven implementation, to a point I felt that it could be used to teach some other programming concepts like code organization, data handling and abstraction.
Our next goal is to use this project as part of future Computer Graphics classes in IFNMG (Salinas, Minas Gerais, Brazil) and create oportunities to develop the project even further in future classes and with the active work of participating of students

All the project's requirements are already included in this repository, for simplicity.
